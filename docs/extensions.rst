.. Extensions sub-module documentation.

#######################################
extensions - CadQuery core enhancements
#######################################
This python module provides extensions to the native CadQuery code base.
Hopefully future generations of CadQuery will incorporate this or similar
functionality.

Examples illustrating how to use much of the functionality of this sub-package
can be found in the
`extensions_examples.py <https://github.com/gumyr/cq_warehouse/blob/main/examples/extensions_examples.py>`_
file.

To help the user in debugging exceptions generated by the Opencascade core, the
dreaded ``StdFail_NotDone`` exception is caught and augmented with a more
meaningful exception where possible (a new exception is raised from
StdFail_NotDone so no information is lost). In addition, python logging is used
internally which can be enabled (currently by un-commenting the logging
configuration code) to provide run-time information in a ``cq_warehouse.log``
file.

********************
CadQuery Integration
********************
In order for cq_warehouse CadQuery extensions to be recognized by IDEs (e.g. Intellisense)
the CadQuery source code needs to be updated. Although monkeypatching allows
for the functionality of CadQuery to be extended, these extensions are not
visible to the IDE which makes working with them more difficult.

The `build_cadquery_patch.py <https://github.com/gumyr/cq_warehouse/blob/main/scripts/build_cadquery_patch.py>`_
script takes the cq_warehouse extensions.py file (from your pip install), reformats it to fit into
the CadQuery source code, applies changes to official Cadquery source files
(the version found with the python ``import cadquery``)
and generates extended versions of these files:

* assembly.py,
* cq.py,
* geom.py, and
* shapes.py.

Finally, a diff is generated between the originals and extended files for use
with the patch command.

.. warning::
	This script is designed to work on all platforms that support the ``diff`` and ``patch``
	commands but has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux.

Usage:

.. doctest::

	>>> python build_cadquery_patch.py
	To apply the patch:
	    cd /home/gumyr/anaconda3/envs/cadquery-dev/lib/python3.9/site-packages/cadquery
	    patch -s -p4 < cadquery_extensions0.5.2.patch
	To reverse the patch:
	    patch -R -p4 < cadquery_extensions0.5.2.patch

This script does not make any changes to your CadQuery installation. The user needs to apply
the patch for the changes to take effect. Reversing the patch will restore the four changed
files. The Linux patch command can also generate versioned backups of the changed files if
the user wants even more security.

Once the patch has been applied, Visual Studio Code will see all the cq_warehouse extensions
as native CadQuery functionality and will show all the type hints and code completion available
with core CadQuery methods. It will look something like this:
