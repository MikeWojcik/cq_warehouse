If you've ever wondered if there is a better alternative to doing mechanical CAD with
proprietary software products, `CadQuery <https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
and this package **cq_warehouse** might be what you've been looking for. CadQuery augments
the Python programming language (the second most widely used programming language) with
powerful capabilities enabling a wide variety of mechanical designs to be created
in S/W with the same techniques that enable most of today's technology.

The **cq_warehouse** augments CadQuery with parametric parts - generated on demand -
and extensions to the core CadQuery capabilities. The resulting parts can be used within your
projects or saved to a CAD file in STEP or STL format (amongst others) for use in a wide
variety of CAD, CAM, or analytical systems.

As an example, consider the design of a simple bearing pillow block:

.. code-block:: python

	import cadquery as cq
	from cq_warehouse.fastener import SocketHeadCapScrew

	height = 60.0
	width = 80.0
	thickness = 10.0
	diameter = 22.0
	padding = 12.0

	# make the screw
	screw = SocketHeadCapScrew(fastener_type="iso4762", size="M2-0.4", length=16, simple=False)
	# make the assembly
	pillow_block = cq.Assembly(None, name="pillow_block")
	# make the base
	base = (
	    cq.Workplane("XY")
	    .box(height, width, thickness)
	    .faces(">Z")
	    .workplane()
	    .hole(diameter)
	    .faces(">Z")
	    .workplane()
	    .rect(height - padding, width - padding, forConstruction=True)
	    .vertices()
	    .clearanceHole(fastener=screw, baseAssembly=pillow_block)
	    .edges("|Z")
	    .fillet(2.0)
	)
	pillow_block.add(base)
	# Render the assembly
	show_object(pillow_block)

Which results in:

With just a few lines of code a parametric part can be created that can be easily
reviewed and version controlled (with tools like `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ and
`github <https://github.com/>`_). Documentation can be autogenerated - as with much
of the documentation that you're reading now - from the source code of your designs.
Parts can be validated automatically with comprehensive test suites to ensure
flaws don't get introduced during the lifecycle of a part. The benefits of a full
S/W development pipeline are too numerous to mention here but also consider that
all of these tools are OpenSource and free to use - no more licenses -
and modifiable if required. Take control of your CAD development tools.
