If you've ever wondered if there is a better alternative to doing mechanical CAD with
proprietary software products, `CadQuery <https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
and this package - `cq_warehouse <https://github.com/gumyr/cq_warehouse>`_ - and similar packages
like `cq_gears <https://github.com/meadiode/cq_gears>`_ might be what you've
been looking for. CadQuery augments
the Python programming language (the second most widely used programming language) with
powerful capabilities enabling a wide variety of mechanical designs to be created
in S/W with the same techniques that enable most of today's technology.

**cq_warehouse** augments CadQuery with parametric parts - generated on demand -
and extensions to the core CadQuery capabilities. The resulting parts can be used within your
projects or saved to a CAD file in STEP or STL format (among others) for use in a wide
variety of CAD, CAM, or analytical systems.

As an example, consider the design of a simple bearing pillow block:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/pillow_block.py

Which results in:

.. image:: pillow_block.png
	:alt: pillow_block

With just a few lines of code a parametric part can be created that can be easily
reviewed and version controlled (with tools like `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ and
`github <https://github.com/>`_). Documentation can be autogenerated - as with much
of the documentation that you're reading now - from the source code of your designs.
Parts can be validated automatically with comprehensive test suites to ensure
flaws don't get introduced during the lifecycle of a part. The benefits of a full
S/W development pipeline are too numerous to mention here but also consider that
all of these tools are OpenSource and free to use - no more licenses -
and modifiable if required. Take control of your CAD development tools.
