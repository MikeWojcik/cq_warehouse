If you've ever wondered if there is a better alternative to doing mechanical CAD with proprietary software products,
[CadQuery](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
and this package - **cq_warehouse** - and similar packages
like [cq_gears](https://github.com/meadiode/cq_gears) might be what you've been looking for. CadQuery augments the Python programming language (the second most widely used programming language) with
powerful capabilities enabling a wide variety of mechanical designs to be created in S/W with the same techniques that enable most of today's technology.


**cq_warehouse** augments CadQuery with parametric parts - generated on demand -
and extensions to the core CadQuery capabilities. The resulting parts can be used within your
projects or saved to a CAD file in STEP or STL format (among others) for use in a wide
variety of CAD, CAM, or analytical systems.

The documentation for **cq_warehouse** can found at [readthedocs](https://cq-warehouse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
